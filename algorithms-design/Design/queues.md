## Queue in System

* When designing a microservice architecture, there are several solutions for defining a queue system, including:

#### Message brokers:
* Using a message broker like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ or AWS SQS can help decouple services and provide a reliable and scalable queue system.
* A message broker, like a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) system, is a type of middleware or intermediary software that facilitates communication and coordination between different components, services, or applications within a distributed computing environment. It acts as a central hub that enables efficient data exchange between various entities.
* The benefits of using a message broker, particularly in a pub-sub pattern, include:

Decoupling: Publishers and subscribers can operate independently, as they don't need to be aware of each other's existence. This enhances system flexibility and modularity.

Scalability: The message broker can handle large numbers of messages and subscribers, making it suitable for applications that need to scale horizontally.

Reliability: The broker ensures that messages are delivered reliably to interested subscribers, even if some subscribers are temporarily offline.

Flexibility: New publishers and subscribers can be added or removed without impacting existing components, simplifying system changes.

* Asynchronous Communication: The pub-sub pattern allows for asynchronous communication, where publishers and subscribers operate independently and at their own pace.

Examples of popular message brokers and pub-sub systems include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub. These systems play a crucial role in building scalable and resilient distributed applications by enabling efficient communication and data sharing among various components.

* In a pub-sub system, the message broker facilitates communication between publishers and subscribers. Here's how it generally works:

#### Service mesh:
* A service mesh like Istio or Linkerd can also provide a queue system through its built-in load balancing and service discovery features.

#### Event-driven architecture: 
* An event-driven architecture can be used to define a queue system where services publish events to a central event bus, which other services subscribe to and consume.

#### Custom implementation: 
* Depending on the specific needs of the architecture, a custom queue system can be implemented using a combination of technologies like Redis, RabbitMQ, and ZeroMQ.
